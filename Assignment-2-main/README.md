# Assignment-2
Assignment 2: MDPs and RL for CS 3600 (Intro to AI) in the Spring 2025 semester!

This repository contains all the files you'll need to get started on Assignment 2: MDPs and RL for CS 3600 (Intro to AI) in the Spring 2025 semester! This assignment will have you implement value iteration, policy iteration, and policy extraction in a GridWorld environment. You'll then implement tabular Q learning in the Text World environment. This assignment is split into two parts. Part A is worth 40 points, and Part B is worth 60 points. The overall assignment, combining the two parts for a total of 100 points, will be worth 12.5% of your final grade for Assignment 2.

## Part A - GridWorld
In Part A of Assignment 2, you will explore the GridWorld environment, where you will implement key concepts in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This part focuses on developing algorithms for value iteration and policy iteration, which are essential for determining optimal policies in MDPs. 

Additionally, you will learn how to extract policies from value functions, enabling you to make decisions based on the computed values. The practical application of these concepts will be demonstrated through coding exercises in the GridWorld environment, where you will simulate agent behavior and evaluate the effectiveness of your implemented algorithms. 

This portion of the assignment is worth 40 points, out of 100 total points for the entire assignment. Your code for policy iteration, value iteration, and policy extraction will be tested on a variety of GridWorld environments, and you will be able to visualize the agent's behavior in real-time. You will be able to create your own configurations to test your implementation, and are encouraged to do so.

## Part B - TextWorld
In Part B of Assignment 2, you will dive back into the TextWorld environment, where you will implement tabular Q-learning, a fundamental algorithm in Reinforcement Learning. This part of the assignment focuses on training an agent to learn optimal policies through interaction with the environment, utilizing rewards and penalties to guide its learning process. You will explore the concepts of exploration versus exploitation, and how to balance these strategies to enhance the agent's performance. 

Additionally, you will analyze the impact of different hyperparameters on the learning process and evaluate the effectiveness of your Q-learning implementation through various scenarios in the TextWorld environment. Practical coding exercises will reinforce these concepts, allowing you to simulate agent behavior and assess the learned policies in real-time.

This portion of the assignment is worth 60 points, out of 100 total points for the entire assignment. Your code for tabular Q-learning will be tested on a variety of TextWorld environments, and you will be able to visualize the agent's behavior in real-time. You will have the ability to load any TextWorld environment to test your implementation, and are encouraged to do so.
