    "The second half of Assignment 3 will be different from previous assignments in this class. You will **not** be interacting with TextWorld or TextWorld-Express for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for this assignment is to create a simple language model based off of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. This language model can then be used to generate text that is similar to the text the model is trained on. We will test your solution on hidden test data that will be used to evaluate the accuracy of your implementation. You will be implementing code to build and generate text from all three the models (Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the assignment, you will be using NumPy extensively, so please familiarize yourself with the NumPy API (see https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html). You are **only** allowed to use a restricted set of libraries for this assignment. All packages that come with the default Python installation are permitted, as well as any imports we have already provided for you. You may not use any other libraries than the ones we have provided. If you attempt to use other libraries, the autograder will not be able to run your code."

The probability table will be a 2D table where dimension 0 is the word in position $n-1$ and dimension 1 is the word in position $n$ and dimension 2 is the probability that $w_n$ occurs directly after $w_{n-1}$. Thus, ideally, if our probability matrix is `p` then `p['you', 'are'] = 0.0089`.\n",

This number will be referred to as a \"token\", but it is also the \"index\" in an arbitrary list of words. Thus is the token for \"you\" is 2 and the token for \"are\" is 3, then `p[2, 3] = 0.0089`.\n",

The vocabulary will have two special tokens, `SOS_token` and `EOS_token`, to indicate the start of a sequence and end of a sequence, respectively. These tokens can be used to demarkate the beginnings and ends of things, which will be useful for generation later."

    "- Creating an empty matrix: `np.zeros(shape)` will create a matrix of shape `shape=(size_of_dim_0, size_of_dim_1, ...)` willed entirely with zeros. For example `np.zeros((2, 3))` will create a $2\\times 3$ matrix of zeros.\n",
    "- Getting the size of a matrix: `some_matrix.shape` is the shape of a numpy matrix as a tuple where each element is the size of each dimension.\n",
    "- Getting an element at a given position can be retrieved using `some_matrix[index1, index2, ...]` or `some_matrix[index1][index2]...`.\n",
    "- Setting: `some_matrix[index1, index2] = some_value` will set an individual element in a matrix at the given indices. This can also be also be done as `some_matrix[index1][index2]... = some_value`.\n",
    "- Slicing: sub-matrices can be extracted by giving spans of indices, similar to how python lists work, but with multiple dimensions. For example `some_matrix[5:10,5:10]` will construct a $5\\times 5$ square matrix that has elements from the original matrix in positions between $(5,5)$ through $(9,9)$\n",
    "- Summing: `some_matrix.sum()` adds all the elements of a matrix together. Numpy matrices have a number of built-in mathematical functions like this.\n",
    "- Mathematical operations: all the normal mathematica operations work as expected in linear algebra. `+` adds element-wise, `*` multiplies element-wise, etc. Matrix shapes must match.\n",
    "- Type casting: `some_matrix.astype(type)` converts every element in the matrix to a particular type, e.g. `some_matrix.astype(int)`."

    "*Perplexity* is a measure of how well a language model captures a dataset. It is a measure of how \"surprised\" the model is when it sees a sequence. If a model has perplexity close to zero, it means that any sequence you throw at the model is very probable according to the model. If the perplexity is high, it means that the sequences it is seeing seem very improbable according to the model. If the sequences are real data from the corpus, then a low perplexity is good because the model is not being surprised by real data. Thus, lower is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for trigram perplexity is $ppl(w)=exp\\big(-\\frac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{n}\\log p(w_t|w_{t-1}, w_{t-2})\\big)$ where $w$ is a word vector conisting of $n$ words $w_1...w_n$. The $log$ maps values between $0...1$ to a scale from $-∞...0$ to avoid multiplying small probability values together. We must add log probabilities instead of multiplying regular probabilities. The $\\frac{1}{n}$ gives us the average log probability. The $-1$ converts log probabilities from numbers less than 0 to numbers greater than 0 so that unlikely word vectors (probabilities close to 0 or log probabilities close to $-∞$) become very high positive numbers (high perplexity). This is also called the *negative log likelihood*, which, counter-intuitively is a positive score.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the final perplexity score, you would then apply a $exp(⋅)$ to map the values in the log scale back to non-log scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize: convert probabilities to log-scale, combine probability chains, get the mean, flip to positive valued numbers, then covert to non-log-scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be making one slight modification to this: we will **not** be converting back to non-log scale. This is because perplexity is mainly used to compare different text generation schemes to each other. Since log perplexity can be compared in the same way perplexity can, we will not be using an $exp(⋅)$ in our calculations."
