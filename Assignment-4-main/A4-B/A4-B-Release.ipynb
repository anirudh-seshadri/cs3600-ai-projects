    "Neural networks are a core component of deep learning, driving advancements in image recognition, natural language processing, robotics, and more. These networks are made up of interconnected layers that transform data through a series of operations, allowing them to learn complex patterns. At the heart of neural networks is the process of learning through gradients, calculated by *backpropagation* and the *chain rule*, which enables the network to adjust its parameters based on how much each parameter contributes to the overall error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern deep learning frameworks like **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** provide powerful abstractions for building and training neural networks, automatically handling gradient calculations and optimization steps. In this part of the assignment, we'll be using PyTorch!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the assignment, we will build a mini neural network framework that supports gradient propagation, allowing us to train a network on a real task and observe how it learns. Specifically, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learn how to handle data inputs**: You will first implement some helper functions that will help you properly process input data and labels for training and evaluation. \n",
    "3. **Implement a Neural Network for Digit Classification (MNIST) using PyTorch**: After building a neural network to solve the XOR problem from scratch, you’ll implement another neural network in PyTorch to experience firsthand how these frameworks abstract many of the complex tasks involved in gradient calculations to solve a classic problem: the MNIST digit classification task. You will also get to tinker with your trained model to see how it performs on some drawings that you'll make!\n",
    "3. **Train and Evaluate on the [Rig Juice](https://regularshow.fandom.com/wiki/Rig_Juice) Classification Task**: Finally, you will train both your custom implementation and the PyTorch version on a *Rig juice classification task*, exploring how each approach learns to classify samples of Rig juice based on a variety of features. This task will help you understand the practical differences between manual implementation and using a modern framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- We've provided all the imports that you'll need for this assignment, though you're welcome to add imports _from the Python Standard Library only_ if you need them. If you want to add any helper functions for whatever reason, please make sure that they are nested inside the function that they are used in. This is to ensure that the autograder can run your code without any issues.\n",
    "- ***DO NOT REMOVE ANY COMMENTS THAT HAVE `# export` IN THEM. THE GRADING SCRIPT USES THESE COMMENTS TO EVALUATE YOUR FUNCTIONS. WE WILL NOT AUDIT SUBMISSIONS TO ADD THESE. IF THE AUTOGRADER FAILS TO RUN DUE TO YOUR MODIFICATION OF THESE COMMENTS, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE CREDIT.***\n"

    "When wandering the vast expanse of TextWorld, you've encountered a special power-up, courtesy of your good friend, Rigby: **RIG JUICE**. It's a strange, vibrant liquid that seems to have a mind of its own. It can be used to power up your search through TextWorld, but it also has a tendency to cause the agent to explode if it's unsafe. Luckily, you've been given a dataset with the characteristics of the different possible Rig Juice flavors (Rigby tends to invent new flavors on the fly). \n",

    "Rig juice is a juice that contains random items that Rigby finds, and since its conception, it has become a highly-valued substance in the TextWorld economy. Although little is known about the makeup of each jug of Rig juice found, they have unique ingredients and have been made with mysterious processes that make them highly sought after by explorers. For more information about Rig juice and its wondrous effects, [check out the following link](https://regularshow.fandom.com/wiki/Rig_Juice). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because they can be made with some wild ingredients, we need to make sure that the Rig juice that we're dealing with is safe. Many health experts in the TextWorld community have found poisonous jugs of Rig juice in the wild (Rigby's a careless guy sometimes). Our task is to use a neural network to determine whether a given jug of Rig juice is **poisonous** or **non-poisonous**, to ensure that our agent doesn't get injured in their journey. By training our neural network on this dataset, we want to achieve a high accuracy in a [binary classification](https://www.learndatasci.com/glossary/binary-classification/) of Rig juice. This will help improve our understanding the uniqueness of Rig juice to harness its utility to effectively search through TextWorld.  "

You do NOT have to do anything (e.g. remove print statements) to cells we have provided - anything related to those have been handled for you. You are responsible for ensuring your own code has no syntax errors or unnecessary print statements. You ***CANNOT*** modify the export comments at the top of the cells, or the autograder will fail to run on your submission.\n",

Only the provided cells will be graded. As mentioned in the top of the notebook, **any helper functions that you add should be nested within the function that uses them.**\n",

We highly recommend making a public post to clarify any questions, as it's likely that other students have the same questions as you!
