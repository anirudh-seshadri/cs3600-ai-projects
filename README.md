## 📁 Projects

### 🔍 Project 1: Search Algorithms
Implemented A*, BFS, and UCS to navigate an agent through a maze environment.

### 📊 Project 2: Probabilistic Inference
Built a Bayes Net to perform inference over uncertain environments using the variable elimination algorithm.

### 🎯 Project 3: Reinforcement Learning
Implemented Q-learning and SARSA to train an agent in a gridworld using value iteration.
