# Assignment 1
This repository contains all the files you'll need to get started on Assignment 1: Search for CS 3600 (Intro to AI) in the Spring 2025 semester! This assignment will have you implement search algorithms in text-based adventure games and in graphs implemented in the `networkx` library. This assignment is split into two parts, which will have separate submissions in Gradescope, but will have equal weight (7.5%) in your final grade, to total 15% of your final grade for Assignment 1. 

> You are **not** permitted to fork this repository, as it will create a public repository that you cannot change the visibility of. If you wish to store your code in a GitHub repository, download the source code from this repository, and upload it to a new, private repository on GitHub Enterprise or your personal GitHub account. 

## Part A: Text Adventure Games
For this portion of the assignment, you will be tasked with implementing search algorithms in some text-based adventure games. You'll have to implement the following: 
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS) 
- A* Search
- Heuristic Functions for A* Search
- Some basic helper functions to support the above functions

Be sure to read through the entire notebook to understand the requirements and constraints of the assignment. Grading details and submission instructions are in the [A1-A-release notebook](/A1-A/A1-A-release.ipynb). We've included code in the notebook to download all the necessary environment files, but you may have to download them manually. Follow the directions in the notebook carefully to do this successfully.

## Part B: Search Algorithms in Networkx Graphs
For this portion of the assignment, you will be tasked with implementing some search algorithms in graphs implemented in the `networkx` library. You'll have to implement the following:
- Euclidean distance heuristic
- Greedy Best-First Search
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Bidirectional Uniform Cost Search (Bi-UCS)

Be sure to read through the entire notebook to understand the requirements and constraints of the assignment. You may find some tips helpful in the notebook itself! Grading details and submission instructions are in the [A1-B-release notebook](/A1-B/A1-B-release.ipynb). 

## Misc. 
If you haven't already, make sure you get your development environment setup by following the instructions [here](https://github.gatech.edu/CS-3600-Spring-25/dev-environment-setup).

For any questions, please post on Ed Discussion or come to office hours. We highly recommend making public posts on Ed Discussion to promote discussion between students. Furthermore, public posts make you communicate your questions without simply pasting your code, which is a great way to learn and improve your problem-solving & technical communication skills.

Re: the `.gitignore` file - this is just used for setup purposes and you don't need to worry about it. You may find it useful if you set up your own repository for this assignment, but it is not necessary for the purposes of this assignment. As a reminder, all code you write must be your own work, and should stay private (i.e., if you set up a repo, it **must** be private).
